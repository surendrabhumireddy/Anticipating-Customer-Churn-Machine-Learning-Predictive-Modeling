# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The dataset was analyzed using logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting classifiers. Among these models, gradient boosting achieved the highest accuracy of 85%.

## Key Components

- **Data Analysis**: Explored and preprocessed the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
- **Model Implementation**: Utilized logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting classifiers for prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the performance of each model and identified gradient boosting as the best-performing model with 85% accuracy.
